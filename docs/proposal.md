# Introduction

We are planning on developing a dungeon crawler game reminiscent of The Binding of Issac. The character will navigate between rooms and find new enemies to fight. These rooms will contain combinations of enemies, obstacles, and powerups. The combat will consist of a series of ranged attacks. The character's ranged attacks will be determined by the powerups it is currently holding. The enemies ranged attacks will be determined by the type of that enemy. We plan for the enemies, obstacles, and powerups to be procdurely generated inside each room.

We aren't sure what the visual theme of this game will be quite yet. Currently we are toying with the idea of a futuristic ninja theme.

# Anticipated Technologies

The game will be written in Python. It will rely on the pygame framework to handle the majority of the game's infrastructure.

# Method/Approach

We plan to take an agile approach to this project. Every week we will meet to come up with new features to implement and bugs to fix. We will also assign these tasks to individual team members and report on our work at the next meeting.

# Estimated Timeline

Right now we are still learning what this project will fully entail. We haven't determined this yet.

# Anticipated Problems

* We currently aren't sure how we will be able to handle moving between rooms
* How will the camera work? Will the character be set to the middle of the screen?
  * If so this would take extra work
